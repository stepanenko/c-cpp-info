## C# Notes

C# was designed by **Anders Hejlsberg** (Microsoft) and developed by **Mads Torgersen** (Microsoft) in **2000**.

As of 2021, the most recent version of the language is C# 10.0, which was released in 2021 in .NET 6.0.

C# is a modern **general-purpose, multi-paradigm language: structured, imperative, object-oriented, event-driven, task-driven, functional, generic, reflective, concurrent**.

C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.

C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET.

C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.
