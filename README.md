Angular Elements allows you to convert ordinary Angular components into native web components (custom HTML elements). That's a pretty awesome feature and you actually only need to write two lines of code to get there. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.
